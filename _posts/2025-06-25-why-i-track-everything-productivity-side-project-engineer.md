# 📊 Why I Track Everything: Productivity as a Side-Project Engineer

---

Being a side-project engineer is a weird space. You’ve got full-time work, personal goals, a half-broken 3D printer, and a laser simulation app that somehow turned into a multi-week debugging saga. It’s chaos.

But I love it - **because I track everything.**

---

## 🧠 Why Track?

- Because my brain doesn't scale.
- Because I forget why I started something midway through.
- Because debugging at 1 AM without notes is like doing surgery with the lights off.

---

## 🛠 What I Track

- Hours worked (using Clockify)
- Every major code logic change (in Obsidian dev logs)
- Beam angles (yes, even those)
- Weekly reflections
- Learning milestones and course progress
- Blog ideas, side project expenses, and who still owes me coffee

---

## 🧭 The Real Value

Tracking isn’t about micromanaging myself - it’s about **making context visible**.

When I jump back into a paused project, I know:
- What was working
- What broke
- What I was about to try next
- What file I left a disaster in

It's like time-traveling back into my past brain - without the confusion and panic.

---

## 🗂 My Tool Stack

- 📒 Obsidian - my second brain
- 🧮 Excel - for tracking costs and logic testing
- ⏱ Clockify - time logs for side projects
- ✏ Markdown notes inside each repo

---

## 😅 Why Bother?

Because when life gets busy, **you lose progress fastest at the handoff.**  
Tracking reduces friction. It replaces confusion with clarity.

And yeah, sometimes it's just satisfying to tick a box or log a solved bug.  
No shame in that.

---

## 🧘‍♂️ Final Thoughts

As a side-project engineer, you're not just building systems - you *are* one.  
And good systems log what they do.

So yeah, I track everything.  
Not because I’m obsessed with control, but because **I hate starting from scratch**.

Let me know if you’re tracking too much or not enough - or if your 3D printer just jammed again.
